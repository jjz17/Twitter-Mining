## Develop Tool: How Are My Friend's
Run sentiment analysis on followers/followees recent tweets to gauge average sentiment (positive,neutral,negative) and develop dashboard to visualize data

Time charts for users tracking frequency of pos/neu/neg posts over time

May need to develop MySQL Schema for storage

Dash Tutorial:

Questions to answer:
What are trends in the counts of pos/neu/neg posts over time (days)?
Sort by sentiment?

## IDEA
Collect and process data in one step before pushing to mongo to reduce complexity

Add Cards for KPI page which displays percentages of pos, neu, neg, count of tweets, most positive and most negative accounts

Add button to dashboard to scrape daily data

Research Instagram, Facebook, and other APIs to add additional analytics
